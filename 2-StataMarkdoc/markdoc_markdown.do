             =================================== 
    
             Using Markdown (heading 2)
             -------------------------- 
    
             Writing with __markdown__ syntax allows you to add text and graphs to
             _smcl_ logfile and export it to a editable document format. I will demonstrate
             the process by using the __Auto.dta__ dataset.

             ### Get started with MarkDoc (heading 3)
             I will open the dataset, list a few observations, and export a graph.
             Then I will export the logfile to Microsoft Office docx format.

             Adding a graph or image in the report 
             ====================================== 

             Adding a graph using Markdown
             -----------------------------
    
             In order to add a graph using Markdown, I export the graph in PNG format.
             You can explain the graph in the "brackets" and define the file path in parentheses
             
             ![explain the graph](./graph.png)[h]
			 
			 You can also export to a ton of different file types. (Thanks, pandoc!) So that's actually kind of cool.
             
			 Let's try and add math at the bottom. $y_i=\alpha+\beta_1*X_i$
